### Qwiklabs Assessment: Scale and convert images using PIL

Create and run convert_image.py script inside /images directory. Before that, make the script executable. 

```
chmod +x convert_images.py
./convert_images.py
```

Once images have been converted, change directory to /opt/icons/ and check that the converted images exist

```
cd /opt/icons/
ls
```
